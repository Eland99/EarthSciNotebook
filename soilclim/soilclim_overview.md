# Western U.S. snowpacks, soils, and climate

Analysis of environmental data, including snowpack, soil moisture, and
soil temperature data, is posted here along with a log of research
activities on this project.

//Project begin date: 23 Feb, 2011//

## Objectives

The objective of this project is to understand the influence of seasonal
snowpacks on montane and subalpine soil temperature and moisture.
Possible influences include:

- Insulation of soil during winter, including air-soil temperature offsets and elevational gradients in air vs soil temperature.
- Interannual variability in mean annual soil temperature, winter soil temperature, and spring soil temperature due to year-to-year differences in snowcover duration, snowpack size, timing of snowcover onset or snowmelt, and air temperature during these transitions.
- Timing and amount of soil moisture recharge during snowmelt
- Interannual variability of winter soil moisture due to fall conditions
- Interannual variability in growing season soil moisture due to preceding winter snowpack size.`
