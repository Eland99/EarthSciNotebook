# Western U.S. snowpacks, soils, and climate

Analysis of environmental data, including snowpack, soil moisture, and
soil temperature data, is posted here along with a log of research
activities on this project.

*Project begin date: 23 Feb, 2011*

## Objectives

The objective of this project is to understand the influence of seasonal
snowpacks on montane and subalpine soil temperature and moisture.
Possible influences include:

- Insulation of soil during winter, including air-soil temperature offsets and elevational gradients in air vs soil temperature.
- Interannual variability in mean annual soil temperature, winter soil temperature, and spring soil temperature due to year-to-year differences in snowcover duration, snowpack size, timing of snowcover onset or snowmelt, and air temperature during these transitions.
- Timing and amount of soil moisture recharge during snowmelt
- Interannual variability of winter soil moisture due to fall conditions
- Interannual variability in growing season soil moisture due to preceding winter snowpack size.

## Hypotheses

## Experimental Design

## Methods

* [Data sources/collection](soilclim_data.md) for western U.S. climate and soils data.
* [Data quality control](soilclim_data_qc.md) - Bad data removal procedures
* [Data analysis log](soilclim_analysislog_1.md) 
* [Programming documentation](soilclim_programdocs.md)
* [Statistics](soilclim_statistics.md) - Multiple regression and PCA.
* Data will be analyzed for mountain and lowland sites in the interior western U.S., including the stats of AZ, CO, ID, MT, NM, NV, UT, and WY.

## Results

* [Preliminary data and activity log](soilclim_analysislog_1.md)
* [Publication outline](soilclim_publicationoutline.md) - Journal article outline, including figures and discussion.
