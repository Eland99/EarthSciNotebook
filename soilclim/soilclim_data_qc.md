# Data quality control

This page helps track bad, incomplete, or otherwise excluded data from
SNOTEL sites.

 **See also:** [Project overview](overview),
        [Programming
        documentation](west_stationdata:programdocs), [Data
        collection/prep](west_stationdata:data), [Data
        analysis log](west_stationdata:analysislog_1)

## Procedure for screening data files

- Run testfiles.m
- Run testsensors.m
  - Flag any sensors that look like the data being read is in error.
  - Flag any sensor that appear to have a large level shift in the middle of a water year
  - DO NOT flag missing data (gaps), or short timeseries, this will be taken care of by testfiles.m and nancheck.m`

## Directories and files

Both the //NRCSdata/allsensors_dailly/// and the
//NRCSdata/soilsensors_hourly/// directories contain a ''sitelist.txt
'' file that is generated by the *sitelistgenerator.sh* shell script.
When changes are made to these directories (files added or removed) this
script should be re-run.

* **baddata.txt** is present in //allsensors_daily///. It lists all datafiles, by siteID and year, that should be excluded from analysis. The actual exclusion is performed by `loadsnotel.m` (for now).
* In both data directories (above) there are subdirectories that hold incomplete, empty, or otherwise problematic files.`
