* Mounted treatment IR radiometer on post
* Extended rope at top of stand

** 18 Feb, 2010 **

* Downloaded data from both dataloggers.
* Tested 3 malfunctioning Decagon sensors at sensor leads with the testing datalogger. All appear broken.
* Fixed EDLOG problem with Canopy and Control (input terminal mismatch). They now appear to be working.
* Measured slope and aspect of Met and Forest towers
* Hammered in mounting post for Treatment IR radiometer
* Added ropes at top of stand - still needs signs

** 4 Feb, 2010 **

* Gave Tom Painter and Dave a tour the site and talked science.
* Roped off another 100 feet of forest at the lower east edge of the plot.

** 2 Feb, 2010 **

* Downloaded data from both dataloggers
* Fixed wiring at Mux 2 (one free wire, some terminals a bit loose)
* Verified that wiring from Mux 2 to Forest 1 datalogger is connected correctly.
* Looked for shorts, but didn't find anything too bad - some cable shields are probably touching, but it shouldn't matter (right?).
* Added another 50 feet of rope, but there is still more needed below that.

** 25 Jan, 2010 **

* Downloaded data from both dataloggers
* Reversed wiring for downward looking PAR - should be working now.
* Changed REBS negative correction factor to a negative value in Met1 EDLOG program.
* Roped and signed east side of forest, lower paths still need to be blocked

** 14 Jan, 2010 **

* Met tower 
  * Lowered met tower crossbars - crossbar 1 is at roughly 3.85 m, crossbar 2 is at 3.7m
  * Leveled upward PAR, downward PAR, wind, and Rnet sensors
  * Wind sensor is oriented properly now (arrow facing S) and is unobstructed
  * Reoriented met tower so crossbars are N/S (1) and E/W (2)
  * Connected downward PAR sensor leads, bridged with 560Î© resistor at terminals, and jumpered Diff Low to ground
  * New program (HC_MET1_V2.csi) uploaded. All sensors but downward PAR appear to be working now.
* Forest tower
  * Pointed Canopy IR radiometer horizontally in the downhill direction (southwest)
  * New program (HC_FOREST1_v3.csi) uploaded. This made all the CS-615s work
* Collected data from both dataloggers.

** 10 Jan, 2010 **

* Tried to troubleshoot the Decagon sensor problems
  * Checked junction to MUX wiring and it appears to be sound. Wires are correctly connected and it looks like there is excitation and a signal at the sensor leads.
  * Don't know why there is -INF  or zeros at the Forest1 datalogger (could be faulty sensors)
  * Also tried and 80 ms delay before powering up sensors - didn't help
  * Pit 7 60cm is still going in and out also.
* Downloaded data from Forest1

** 7 Jan, 2010 **

* Downloaded data and uploaded HC_Forest1_v2.csi to Forest1 (small delay change in serial io)
* Attached windset to Met1 logger (with extension) and treatment IR radiometer (with extension) to Forest1
* New signs
* Tried to troubleshoot soil moisture sensors, but two decagons and the 615s are not working
  * Tightened all MUX terminals (this may have fixed one sensor)
  * Checked juction box 1 and it looks OK
  * Found which Campbell sensors are 615's
  * Problem with remaining decagons is likely a wiring problem from junction box to multiplexer (or bad sensors)


2009
----

** 20 Dec, 2009 **

* Downloaded data from Forest1 and Met1 datalogger
* Finished attaching sensors to Met1 and Forest1 dataloggers
* Met1 wind sensor, downward PAR, and forest treatment IR radiometer still not connected

** 18 Dec, 2009 **

* Downloaded data from Forest1 datalogger
* Marked off treatment and control swaths with flagging tapes. Treatment is marked with two flags per branch.
