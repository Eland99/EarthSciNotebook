# Hidden Canyon (Wasatch Mtns, UT)

 **Location description**

* Elevation: 9400 ft
* Aspect: 197-205° (South-Southwest)
* Slope: 20-22° at towers
* Dominant tree species: Engelmann spruce, Subalpine fir, Aspen
* There are 2 [georeferenced grids](georeferencing.md)and other markers.
* Site of [ecohydrology experiments](overview.md)(snowmelt, soil carbon cycling, and plant water balance) 
* Established by the Bowling Lab in the Fall of 2009.

## Measurements

 **Hidden Canyon has:**

* A [meteorological tower](mettowers.md)located in a clearing to the west of the study forest.
* A [forest met tower](mettowers.md)that records aboveground and belowground climate variables in the forest.
* Eight [soil profiles](soilprofiles.md)that measure soil temperature and water content.
* Some [snow measurements](snowmeltlog_1.md), part of the [ecohydrology experiments](overview.md).
* [Soil respiration](soilresplog_1.md) measurements
* [Decomposition measurements](litterbaglog_1.md) using litterbags
* [Xylem water potential](ecosystemwaterlog_1.md)measurements
* All trees have location, species, and status data [here](trees.md).

## Communication

This site is connected to the internet via a wireless modem. This modem
is connected via radio to both dataloggers, so both can be accessed from
the Bowling lab with LoggerNet. See [this page](communicationsystem.md) for information on how this works.
