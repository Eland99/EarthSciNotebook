## Oct 28

* 9:15am - Sent new program (v5) to Forest datalogger that includes profiles 6 and 8.
* EDIT (1-6-2012): apparently I forgot to average the new sensor readings and add them to the output table, so it will have to be resent.

## Oct 26

* Wired up all new sensors to MUX3 - P6, 8, 9 & 10.
* Fixed IR radiometer on met tower
* Datalogger working - not sure what this intermittent problem is about - will look at data

## Oct 22

* Installed Sentek sensors in profiles 9 and 10 using slurry method
* Mid-day water potential measurements (skipped big trees)
* Wired sensors
* Datalogger not working?

## Oct 16

* Predawn (6:30-7:30am) water potential measurements (skipped large trees).
* Measured surface soil moisture w/ campbell handheld probe at all locations (morning).
* Soil respiration measurements (10-1pm)

## Oct 15

* Collected litterbags
* Installed 2 new soil moisture profiles (6 and 8) in plots 3 and 4
* There is a problem with the datalogger again - doesnt appear to be getting good data. Maybe the datalogger needs replacing?

## Oct 11

* Had to resend datalogger program again

## Sept 23

* Midday(1:30pm-2:30pm) and predawn (6:10-7:10am) water potential measurements (skipped large trees due to lack of pressure gas).

* Soil respiration measurements (10-1)

## Sept 9-10

* Midday(3:30pm-5pm) and predawn (6-7:30am) water potential measurements (including large trees).
* Measured surface soil moisture w/ campbell handheld probe at all locations (morning of 10th).
* Soil respiration measurements (9th - 1-3pm).
* Restarted Forest1 datalogger - there may be a gap present in the data around this time.

## Aug 26-27

* Midday(3pm-5pm) and predawn (5-7am) water potential measurements (including large trees).

## Aug 11-12

* Midday(2:30pm-4pm) and predawn (5-7am) water potential measurements.
* Added large trees from Plots 1 & 2 to xylem wp measurements (5 trees in each plot - subset of last year's trees)
* Measured surface soil moisture w/ campbell handheld probe at all 6 plots, 6 locations each (morning of 12th).
* Soil respiration measurements (12th - 9-11:30am).

## July 28 - Mike B.

* Midday(12pm-1:30pm) and predawn (6-7am) water potential measurements.
* Soil respiration measurements (9-11:30am).

## July 20 - Davis U.

* Fixed all guywires etc on weather stations with Davis.

## July 13-14

* First midday xylem water potential measurements around 3-5pm
* Hammered in soil collars, 4 per plot, adjacent to litterbags (but randomized)
* First predawn xylem water potential around 5-7am (14th)
* First soil respiration at 9-12am (14th)

## July 12 - Davis U.

* SWE at ALL locations (and all were melted)
* Took photos of the spatial extent of snowmelt.
* Logged melted grid points (only one still has snow)
* Collected litterbags (except for P3-2 which was still snowcovered)

## June 29

* Measured SWE at ALL locations
* Took photos of the spatial extent of snowmelt.
* Logged melted grid points

## June 23

* Measured SWE at 12 locations per treatment
* Took photos of the spatial extent of snowmelt.
* Collected snow columns for total dust loading measuremnts - 1 per plot
* Logged melted grid points

## June 15

* 6th dust application
* Measured SWE at 12 locations in each plot
* Took photos
* Met tower IR thermometer has a loose wire (EX terminal)
* Plot 2 has melted out in the middle of the plot, and litterbag set 3 is exposed.
* 30N 30E stake is almost exposed melted out.

## June 7

* Took gas samples from all inlets
* Collected dust cores in the open from the last few dust events
* Reconnected Forest1 datalogger to its radio

## June 1

* Dust dep 5
* Fixed MUX1 problem - moving snowpack had pulled the COM terminals loose (at the MUX)
* Took a few photos

## May 27

## Apr 12

* Collected exetainer samples from all inlets (Measured these the following morning - :!: all were atmospheric:!:).
* Measured SWE in plots 1-4

## Apr 2

* Measured SWE in all plots, these are good numbers this time. Used lube on tubes.
* Collected "after" sublimation samples from N & S facing slopes in HC

## Mar 31

* First dust deposition, on all 3 treatment plots

## Mar 27

* Fixed/replaced ropes
* Wired charging station together and connected battery
* Dug out solar tower a bit.

## Mar 23
