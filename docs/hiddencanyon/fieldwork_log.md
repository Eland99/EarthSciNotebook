* Messed around with datalogger wiring, but was not able to restore measurements of soil sensors.

** Mar 21, 2012 **

Made a quick trip up to try to fix soil moisture datalogging again.
Still having trouble identifying the problem.

* Excavated snow around base of forest datalogger post and checked wires.
* Retaped some chewed (lightly chewed) wires and tried to put more slack in them - didn't seem to do much though.
* Disconnected treatment IR radiometer, and forest Vaisala (not sure if this will help or not, but these sensors are malfunctioning anyways.)
* When I left all sensors were working, though sometimes intermittently it seemed.
* Took a snow sample from the board (2 cores, 37cm depth).

** Mar 12, 2012 **

* Sampled all inlets
* Measured SWE in all plots (3 measurements each)
* The bad soil profile data problem returned, so I excavated the snow at the post and left everything uncovered. There are some chewed up wires there (since retaped) but not sure if this is where the problem is or not. All soil moisture sensors are failing to read, not just the ones with chewed wires. Hopefully this will keep the data coming in for a while.

** Mar 8, 2012 **

Noticed soil profiles were not working (all data was -6999) yesterday,
went up to fix this.

* Fixed one loose wire on MUX3 (Sentek sensor profile 9)
* There seems to be some loose wiring at the base of the Forest1 datalogger post, but it is difficult to identify. Excavating the snow and adjusting the wire caging seemed to help. 
* Re-covered the base with snow.

* Sampled all inlets
* Measured swe in all plots (4 measurements each)
* Lowered ropes a bit

* Went to Hidden Canyon and sent v6 program to Forest1 datalogger manually
* As of the 4pm data collection this appears to be working (except for profile 10 sentek sensor) - there is new data starting at 2pm.

** Jan 8, 2012 **

* Rewrote and sent a datalogger program to Forest1 datalogger. Program includes sentek sensors and new CS-616s in measurements and final storage table (averages).
* Sent at ~4pm after downloading all data and archiving it
* resent at 12am (9th) - doesn't appear to be sending the program, probably because the radio is turning off.

** Jan 4, 2012 **

* Sampled all inlets
* SWE measurements in plot 1, 2, 3, 4 (4 measurements each)
* Rewired Sentek sensors (12V power and Gnd are now on the terminal strips with the 616's)

* Verified that wiring from Mux 2 to Forest 1 datalogger is connected correctly.
* Looked for shorts, but didn't find anything too bad - some cable shields are probably touching, but it shouldn't matter (right?).
* Added another 50 feet of rope, but there is still more needed below that.

** 25 Jan, 2010 **

* Downloaded data from both dataloggers
* Reversed wiring for downward looking PAR - should be working now.
* Changed REBS negative correction factor to a negative value in Met1 EDLOG program.
* Roped and signed east side of forest, lower paths still need to be blocked

** 14 Jan, 2010 **

* Met tower 
  * Lowered met tower crossbars - crossbar 1 is at roughly 3.85 m, crossbar 2 is at 3.7m
  * Leveled upward PAR, downward PAR, wind, and Rnet sensors
  * Wind sensor is oriented properly now (arrow facing S) and is unobstructed
  * Reoriented met tower so crossbars are N/S (1) and E/W (2)

* Tried to troubleshoot the Decagon sensor problems
  * Checked junction to MUX wiring and it appears to be sound. Wires are correctly connected and it looks like there is excitation and a signal at the sensor leads.
  * Don't know why there is -INF  or zeros at the Forest1 datalogger (could be faulty sensors)
  * Also tried and 80 ms delay before powering up sensors - didn't help
  * Pit 7 60cm is still going in and out also.
* Downloaded data from Forest1

  * Tightened all MUX terminals (this may have fixed one sensor)
  * Checked juction box 1 and it looks OK
  * Found which Campbell sensors are 615's
  * Problem with remaining decagons is likely a wiring problem from junction box to multiplexer (or bad sensors)
