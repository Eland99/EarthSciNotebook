# Earth Systems and Ecology Notebook

![Hidden Canyon datalogger](media/hiddencanyon/hcimg_3855_scaled_.jpg){width=225px align=right}

This is a wikified set of notes about earth systems and ecological research. It is written by [Greg Maurer](http://greg.pronghorns.net) and serves basically as my research notebook, documenting activities for various projects, lab and field procedures, notes on data analysis and statistics, preliminary results, and other general info on the nuts and bolts of doing research in the environmental sciences. Its not particularly organized or well-written, but I am posting it so that others might derive some value from it.

**Cautionary note:**

All data, code, figures, results, and discussions are presented in their
raw, preliminary form. They have not been peer reviewed and are provided
without guarantee of quality, accuracy, or safety. Feel free to contact me with questions and to suggest changes or additions.
