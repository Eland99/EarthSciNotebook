# IPython

Assorted notes on using the ipython interactive shell. Official
documentation is at <http://ipython.org>.

 **See also:** [General programming](programming.md), [Python notes](python_notes.md) pages.

## Basics

* **Pylab** - Starting ipython with the `--pylab` option imports
        numpy and matplotlib libraries into the workspace.

* **Inline help** - Following any object of function name with a
        "?" gives info or documentation about the item.

* **Shell access** - to run a command in the system shell prefix
        it with an exclamation point: `!ping www.bbc.co.uk`

* **ipdb** - ipython has an enhanced debugger (not sure if this is
        enabled by default :!:)

## Magic commands

IPython "magic" commands operate only within IPython, and are prefaced
by %. If the flag %automagic is set, then magic commands can be called
without the %. (%automagic is on by default.). These commands include:

* Functions that work with code: %run, %edit, %save, %macro, %recall, etc.
* Functions which affect the shell: %colors, %xmode, %autoindent, etc.
* Other functions such as %reset, %timeit or %paste.
* To see all the available magic functions, call %lsmagic.
* [This](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/api/generated/IPython.core.magic.html#module-IPython.core.magic)lists all the core magic functions.`

### %run

Run any python script and load all of its data directly into the
interactive namespace. Since the file is re-read from disk each time,
changes you make to it are reflected immediately (unlike imported
modules, which have to be specifically reloaded). %run has special flags
for timing the execution of your scripts (-t), or for running them under
the control of either Pythonâ€™s pdb debugger (-d) or profiler (-p).

You can step through a program from the beginning by calling `%run -d
theprogram.py`

### %who, %whos

Print all interactive variables, with minimal (%who) or extensive
(%whos) formatting. If any arguments are given, only variables whose
type matches one of these are printed. For example:

~~~
#This will list functions and strings, excluding all other types of variables
%who function str
~~~

### %edit

Gives a reasonable approximation of multiline editing, by invoking your
favorite editor on the spot. IPython will execute the code you type in
there as if it were typed interactively.

### %debug, %pdb, %prun

After an exception occurs, you can call `%debug` to jump into the Python
debugger (pdb) and examine the problem. Alternatively, if you call `%pdb`,
IPython will automatically start the debugger on any uncaught exception.
`%prun` will run a statement through the python code profiler.


## The Qt console

IPython has a ligthweight, Qt enhanced terminal that allows some extra
functionality.

* The Debian package: ipython-qtconsole.
* Start with: ipython qtconsole
* arguments can be passed to this start statement (`--pylab`)
* type `%guiref` to see a quick introduction of its main features.
* [Feature description](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/interactive/qtconsole.html)


## Features

### Multi-line editing

To input and edit code on multiple lines press Ctrl-Enter after the
first line. This puts the console in multiline editing mode and
additional lines can be added and edited. To run the lines of code
append a blank line and hit Enter or use Shift-Enter.

### %loadpy

The `%loadpy` magic takes any python script (must end in `.py`), and
pastes its contents as your next input, so you can edit it before
executing.

### Inline plotting

Matplotlib plots can now be displayed right in the terminal window. To
make this happen all the time, start the qtconsole with:
`--pylab=inlineMatplotlib` figures can also be individually embedded in
the qtconsole workspace using something like `display(gcf())`

### Saving "notebooks"

Qtconsole activity can be saved in HTML or XHTML, with inline figures in
PNG or SVG format. To switch the inline figure format to use SVG during
an active session, do:

    In [10]: %config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'
