# Vaisala GMP 252 CO~2~ probe

## General

## Installation

Fits inside a 1 inch Schedule 40 PVC pipe, but in order to fint a membrane the thinner-walled 1 inch class 200 will be preferable.

Membrane materials:

    * Tyvek 1443R - light (1.25oz/yd), thin (5.3mil), strong, water resistant, pretty easy to work with.
    * Gore-Tex socks - source?

## Datalogger programming

Sensors can output data in several configurations, both analog (voltage and current) and digital (Modbus).

### Single ended voltage measurement

With probes configured for analog output at 0-5V, a single ended or differential voltage measurement can be used to measure the probe. In Campbell dataloggers the relevant commands are SeVolt

    

## Temperature, pressure, and other compensations

Temperature compensation can be performed by
