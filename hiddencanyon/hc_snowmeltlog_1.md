## Spring 2010 snowmelt log

{{ :hc_ecohydrology:treatment2_100424.jpg?250|Just after dust
application on April 24th, 2010}}

* First dust application of spring. Used slightly over three mason jars. Also - forgot to bring the Federal sampler so will have to measure next week and add any losses seen from nearby SNOTEL sites. Photos to come.  --- //[Greg`

* Second dust application. Used 4 mason jars and measured SWE in control and treatment (n=6) swaths. Also took 3 SWE measurements to the east of the treatment swath in similar stand density areas for additional comparison. --- //[Greg`

* Third dust application. Used 4 mason jars and measured SWE in control and treatment (n=6) swaths. Also took 3 SWE measurements to the east of the treatment swath in similar stand density areas for additional comparison.  --- //[Greg`

* Fourth dust application - used 3.5 mason jars --- //[Greg`

* Fifth dust application - used 3.5 mason jars --- //[Greg`

* Sixth dust application (3.5 mason jars), and Treatment swath is beginning to melt out. --- //[Greg`
`Maurer](primaryproductivity@gmail.com)2010/06/03 14:15//
* Measured SWE - 6/10 Treatment plot SWE points are melted out. 3/10 Control plot SWE points are melted out. --- //[Greg`

* Our total dust loading for the year was roughly 36g m`^`-2`^\
* This appeared to at least double the total natural snowpack dust loading rate for the Wasatch of 20-36g m`^`-2`^(from Anne Bryant and Tom Painter's work at Alta).`

Snowmelt plots
--------------

NOTE the presence of the East Control directly east of the treatment
swath! It was created to measure spatial variability in SWE from the
clearing to the center of the stand. The first measurement was made on
April 8th, 2010 and the last measurement was made on June 23rd.

## Spring 2011 snowmelt log

{{ :hc_ecohydrology:hcplot4_110512.jpg?350|Plot 4 on May 12, 2011}}

* **31 March, 2011**: First dust application of spring on 31 March, 2011. Used slightly over three mason jars per plot. SWE measurements were made difficult by freezing inside of tube so will have to return and remeasure.  --- //[Greg`
`Maurer](primaryproductivity@gmail.com)2011/04/04 12:09//
* **April 2**: Remeasured SWE using lubricant in the sampling tubes - it worked this time and it looks like measurements on the 31st were off by at least 200mm of SWE.  --- //[Greg`

* See [Hidden`Canyon`
`log](hiddencanyon:hc2011_log)for other SWE measurement and dust deposition dates.
* **June 15** First bare ground occurred  at the middle of plot 2 (near 30E, 30N stake) - continued grid measurements at several time periods this year
* ** June 23 **Collected snow columns for total dust loading measurements - 1 per plot
* ** July 12 ** Snowmelt was complete (except for a small area in plot 3 - near litterbag set 2).
* **Aug 8**: Tuned up the //hc_melt.py// program to plot out the 2011 snowmelt season. Looks, in general like dust had no effect on the rate of melt at Hidden Canyon.`
