Sept 9
------

-------

* Hemispherical photos of all litterbag/collar and soil profile locations - with Tasha.

July 11
-------

* Measured LiCor respiration at all collars.

* Surface VWC measurements at all locations.

June 25
-------

* Measured LiCor respiration at all collars.
* Sapling (only) pre-dawn and mid-day xylem water potential
* Surface VWC measurements at all locations.

June 18
-------

* Did all DOSE measurements

June 4
------

* Measured LiCor respiration at all collars - Note that the IRGA was spanned in the lab last week.
* Mature/sapling pre-dawn and mid-day xylem water potential
* Surface VWC measurements at all locations.
* Collected the last litterbag (P3-2)

May 31
------

* Collected all litterbags.
* Logged snowcover at all grid points (one remaining - 30E, 20N).
* Moved and reinserted all respiration collars (<1m from last years location).

May 21
------

* Measured SWE at all plots and reps.
* Logged snowcover at all grid points
* Snow cover is effectively gone, except from 2 measurement locations (bags/collars)

May 14
------

* Measured SWE at all plots, all reps.
* Logged snowcover at all grid points (and other points).

May 8
-----

* Measured SWE in all plots. all 6 measurements.
* Logged snowcover at all grid points (and other points).
* Messed with datalogger
* Collected full column cores from each plot for dust loading analysis.

Apr 30
------

* Fourth dust deposition - all 6 plots, ~3000g each
* Messed with datalogger
* Logged snow at all grid points

Apr 27
------

* Measured SWE in all plots, 4 measurements each
* Sampled all inlets
* 3 full column samples taken for dust loading
* Messed with datalogger

Apr 24
------

* Took hemispherical canopy photos at all SWE measurement points
* Fiddled with forest datalogger
* Logged clear grid points - there were several.

Apr 19
------

* Measured SWE in all plots, 5 measurements each
* Third dust deposition - all 6 plots, ~3000g each
* Messed with datalogger again

Apr 15
------

* Sampled all inlets
* Measured SWE in plots 1-4 (2 measurements each)
* Messed with datalogger again...

Apr 10
------

* Second dust deposition - all 6 plots, ~3000g each
* Measured SWE in all plots. n=6 in all 6 plots.
* Messed with datalogger again - seems to be the wiring below the box, was working ok when I left.

Apr 3
-----

* Visited to try and fix sensor problems again - not sure if it worked.
* Dust is still visible on the treatment plots, despite the new snow from a few days ago.

Mar 30
------

* First dust deposition - all 6 plots, ~3000g each
* Measured SWE in all plots. n=2 in plots 1-4, n=4 in 5&6 - figured I could count some of the measurements from earlier in the week for plots 5 & 6.

Mar 27
------

* Sampled all inlets
* Measured SWE in plots 1-4 (3 measurements each)
* Messed around with datalogger wiring, but was not able to restore measurements of soil sensors.

Mar 21
------

Made a quick trip up to try to fix soil moisture datalogging again.
Still having trouble identifying the problem.

* Excavated snow around base of forest datalogger post and checked wires.
* Retaped some chewed (lightly chewed) wires and tried to put more slack in them - didn't seem to do much though.
* Disconnected treatment IR radiometer, and forest Vaisala (not sure if this will help or not, but these sensors are malfunctioning anyways.)
* When I left all sensors were working, though sometimes intermittently it seemed.
* Took a snow sample from the board (2 cores, 37cm depth).

Mar 12
------

* Sampled all inlets
* Measured SWE in all plots (3 measurements each)
* The bad soil profile data problem returned, so I excavated the snow at the post and left everything uncovered. There are some chewed up wires there (since retaped) but not sure if this is where the problem is or not. All soil moisture sensors are failing to read, not just the ones with chewed wires. Hopefully this will keep the data coming in for a while.

Mar 8
-----

Noticed soil profiles were not working (all data was -6999) yesterday,
went up to fix this.

* Fixed one loose wire on MUX3 (Sentek sensor profile 9)
* There seems to be some loose wiring at the base of the Forest1 datalogger post, but it is difficult to identify. Excavating the snow and adjusting the wire caging seemed to help. 
* Re-covered the base with snow.

Feb 18
------

* Sampled all inlets
* Measured swe in all plots (4 measurements each)
* Lowered ropes a bit
* Modified Forest1 datalogger program to get Sentek sensor at profile 10 running finally (had to remove loops in program).
* Put out stormboard.

Jan 17
------

* Went to Hidden Canyon and sent v6 program to Forest1 datalogger manually
* As of the 4pm data collection this appears to be working (except for profile 10 sentek sensor) - there is new data starting at 2pm.

Jan 8
-----

* Rewrote and sent a datalogger program to Forest1 datalogger. Program includes sentek sensors and new CS-616s in measurements and final storage table (averages).
* Sent at ~4pm after downloading all data and archiving it
* resent at 12am (9th) - doesn't appear to be sending the program, probably because the radio is turning off.

Jan 4
-----

* Sampled all inlets
* SWE measurements in plot 1, 2, 3, 4 (4 measurements each)
* Rewired Sentek sensors (12V power and Gnd are now on the terminal strips with the 616's)
