##### 2010 Pilot project - Experimental design

{{ :hiddencanyon:hc\_fieldsite.jpg?600|A schematic of the treatment and
control plots and installed profiles in 2010}} There are two 10 by \~60
meter plots in the Hidden Canyon forest that are parallel to each other
and separated by a 5m corridor. One swath serves as the treatment plot
and receives regular [dust additions](procedures:dustonsnow)
during the spring. The other is a control and receives only natural dust
loading. Each plot is instrumented as follows:

` * One Apogee infrared radiometer to measure snow surface temperature`\
` * Two soil moisture profiles with Campbell CS-615/16 sensors at 5, 20, and 60cm depths. One is in an upslope position and one is in a dowslope position.`\
` * Two soil moisture AND temperature profiles, each with 3 Decagon EC-TM sensors at the same depths. Again, one of these profiles is high and one is low.`\
` * Additional measurements for the soil carbon cycling and water balance parts of the experiment (see `[`project`
`overview`](hc_ecohydrology:overview)`) are replicated in each each plot.`

##### 2011 Experimental design

For the 2011 snowmelt season, the experiment has been scaled up to 3
dust treatment plots, and 3 controls, each around 10 x 70m. Additional
soil moisture and temperature profile measurements have been added in
two of these plots (3 & 4) and water balance and carbon cycle
measurements will also be deployed within these new areas.
