# Hidden Canyon (Wasatch Mtns, UT)

 **Location description**

* Elevation: 9400 ft
* Aspect: 197-205° (South-Southwest)
* Slope: 20-22° at towers
* Dominant tree species: Engelmann spruce, Subalpine fir, Aspen
* There are 2 [georeferenced`
`grids](hiddencanyon/hc_georeferencing)and other markers.
* Site of [ecohydrology`
`experiments](hiddencanyon/hc_ecohydrology:overview)(snowmelt, soil carbon cycling, and plant water balance) 
* Established by the Bowling Lab in the Fall of 2009.`

## Measurements

 **Hidden Canyon has:**

* A [meteorological`
`tower](hiddencanyon/hc_mettowers)located in a clearing to the west of the study forest.
* A [forest`met`
`tower](hiddencanyon/hc_mettowers)that records aboveground and belowground climate variables in the forest.
* Eight [soil`
`profiles](hiddencanyon/hc_soilprofiles)that measure soil temperature and water content.
* Some [snow`
`measurements](hiddencanyon/hc_ecohydrology:snowmeltlog_1), part of the [ecohydrology`
`experiments](hiddencanyon/hc_ecohydrology:overview).
* [Soil`
`respiration](hiddencanyon/hc_ecohydrology:soilresplog_1)measurements
* [Decomposition`
`measurements](hiddencanyon/hc_ecohydrology:litterbaglog_1)using litterbags
* [Xylem`water`
`potential](hiddencanyon/hc_ecohydrology:ecosystemwaterlog_1)measurements
* All trees have location, species, and status data [here](trees).`

## Communication

This site is connected to the internet via a wireless modem. This modem
is connected via radio to both dataloggers, so both can be accessed from
the Bowling lab with LoggerNet. See [this
page](hiddencanyon/hc_communicationsystem) for information on
how this works.
