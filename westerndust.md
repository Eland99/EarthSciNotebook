# Dust composition and origin

[[media/misc/dustmap.jpg|width=300px|align=left|alt="Dust collection sites
along the Buckhorn Draw Road (San Rafael Swell, UT"]] Dust used in this
project is derived from the Chinle-Moenkopi formation of the Colorado Plateau.
The nutrient and chemical composition has been described in [Neff et al,
2006](http://www.springerlink.com/content/8q3412683074272n/). This dust was
collected on 20 Feb, 2010 along the Buckhorn Draw Road in the San Rafael
Swell of Utah. This material was wet at the time of collection. It was dried
and then sifted to .5mm before application.

## Chinle 1

**Coordinates:** 39.112961째 N 110.680463째 W

The road cuts directly below a Chinle/Moenkopi (probably Chinle)
exposure and there is material collected between the road and the base
of this wall. Brick red, material is directly below outcrop and is
rather shaley still (blocky pebbles mixed with finer material).

## Chinle 2

**Coordinates:** 39.111881째 N 110.679688째 W

Around the corner (SE) the road cuts throuh a fan of soil and rock
debris below multiple chinle outcrops, with a wingate cliff towering
above it. The fan is lightly vegetated with junipers, rabbitbrush, etc.
This material was dug out of the roadcut. It is also brick red, slightly
lighter, and is generally finer textured than Chinle 1. There are
inclusions of a beige to blue crumbly sandstone within it. It may be a
combination of Chinle/Moenkopi and weathered Wingate/Navajo from above.
