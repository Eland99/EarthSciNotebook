This is the wiki for [Greg Maurer's](http://pronghorns.net/about.html)
research projects, which are focused on biogeochemical cycling in the
seasonally snow-covered ecosystems of the western U.S. This research is based
at the [Bowling lab](http://bioweb.biology.utah.edu/bowling/), in the 
[University of Utah Biology Department](http://www.biology.utah.edu).

**Cautionary note:**

All data, code, figures, results, and discussions are presented in their

This [wp>wiki](wp>wiki) records day to day research
activities for various research projects, including field and lab notes,
method development, preliminary results, data analysis code, figures,
photos, and discussions. It is essentially an open version of the
electronic [wp>lab notebook](wp>lab_notebook) for [Greg
Maurer's](http://pronghorns.net/about.html) research
projects. Because it is a wiki, this site can also be used for
scientific collaboration. Those who would like to add to, comment on, or
