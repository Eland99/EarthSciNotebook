# Lab processing of SNOTEL site samples

=

3 circular plots (10m diameter) are sampled in each forest. 6 soil
sampling locations are randomly selected in each plot. Note that in 2008
soil sampling happened at only 5 locations per plot and there were no
bulk density measurements.

See the [SNOTEL field sampling page](snotelfieldprotocol) for
more on sampling methods

 **Samples returned **

- 3 litter bags --- 1 per plot, aggregates of 6 sampled locations per plot (15x15cm quads - 225cm`^`2`^`).
- 3 O-horizon samples --- 1 per plot, aggregate of 6 sampled locations per plot. These may be in multiple bags. Area sampled varies but is known.
- 3 Mineral soil (0-10cm depth) --- 1 per plot, aggregate of 6 sample locations per plot.
- 3 bulk density tins (0-10cm depth) --- 1 per plot, absent at extremely rocky locations.
- 3 bulk density tins (10-20cm depth) --- 1 per plot, absent at extremely rocky locations.
- 9 tree increment cores --- 3 per plot, including 1 from largest tree in plot.`

 **Data returned **

- Depth of organic horizon for each plot --- average of 4 measurements at each of 6 sampling locations in the plot
- Coarse woody debris (> 5cm) volume --- length and center diameter of all CWD within plot
- Diameter at breast height of each tree in all three plot
- Estimate of percent cover of the understory in each plot (this is a **rough** estimate)
- Slope and aspect of each plot`

## Litter

- Oven dry sample bags until dry. This may take multiple days.
- Empty the bag into a tared weigh tray (a tupperware most likely).
- Remove any rocks and weigh them.
- Weigh the bulk litter remaining in the tared weigh tray.
- Sort out CWD (> 0.5cm) and weigh remaining fine litter and leaves.
- Homogenize the remaining sample and take a representative subsample for grinding
- Grind this well-mixed subsample of litter and archive in a labeled sample cup`

## O horizon

- Oven dry sample bags
- Empty the bag into a tared weigh tray.
- Remove rocks & weigh them.
- Weigh the bulk organic soil remaining in the tared weigh tray.
- Sort out CWD (>0.5cm) & weigh the remaining organic soil sample.
- Sample fine roots if available and put in coin envelope (1 per site) for later analysis.
- Homogenize the remaining sample and take 2 representative subsamples:
  - One sample sifted through 2mm mesh to remove fine roots, then save ~20g of each (>2mm & <2mm fractions) for density fractionation.
  - A larger bulk sample ground in coffee grinder and archived in a sample cup for further SOM analysis.`

The first sample will be separated with [density
fractionation](procedures:soildensityfractionation) and
fractions then undergo [prep for
EA-IRMS](procedures:ea-irms_soilprep) analysis. The second
sample can be subsampled for immediate [prep for
EA-IRMS](procedures:ea-irms_soilprep) analysis.

## Mineral 0-10

- Oven dry sample bags
- Weigh bulk sample in a tared weigh tray.
- Sift sample through 2mm screen.
- Weigh any rocks (>2mm) remaining on the screen.
- If there are roots left on the screen, sample them and place in a coin envelope for later analysis (1 envelope per site/per depth)
- Homogenize the remaining (<2mm) sample and take a representative subsample for archiving in labeled sample cup.
- Weigh or archive all remaining >2mm material (roots and wood).

Note that for 2008 samples half of the oven-dried bulk samples were
immediately archived for rock, sand, silt, clay fraction analysis.

The archived soil sample can be further subsampled for [density
fractionation](procedures:soildensityfractionation) (with
fractions then undergoing [prep for
EA-IRMS](procedures:ea-irms_soilprep)), or for immediate
[prep](procedures:ea-irms_soilprep) and EA-IRMS analysis.

## Fine roots

- While sifting organic and mineral samples above, sample intact fine roots and place in a coin envelope.`

## Bulk Density Tins

- Oven dry tins
- Record tin weight written on bottom of tin
- Weigh dry sample tins (without lids)
- Sift to 2mm - wet sifting may be necessary for this.
- Measure volume of rocks remaining in screen (>2mm sample) by volume displacement.
- Archive any roots, wood, or charcoal remaining in the screen (>2mm sample).
- Weigh sifted sample (<2mm)`

## Intact cores

- Remove end caps and place cores (still in liners) on a tray or tin in the drying oven.
- Once dry, cores should slide out of the liners into a tared weigh tray. Be careful not to lose any soil.
- Weigh the cores.
- Sift to 2mm - wet sifting may be necessary for this.
- Measure volume of rocks remaining in screen (>2mm sample) by volume displacement.
- Archive any roots, charcoal, or wood remaining in the screen (>2mm sample).
- Weigh sifted sample (<2mm) and archive for later analysis.`
