## SNOTEL survey - Sample processing log

This logs any work done on samples returned from the visits to SNOTEL
sites.

**See also:**

* The sampling spreadsheet in the project directory logs EVERY sample returned from the field.
* The [Sample tables](snotelC/snotelC_sampletables.md)page summarizes the samples for each site and their processing/analysis history.
* The [SNOTEL visit log](snotelC/snotelC_log_1.md)for notes on site visits.
* The [initial processing procedures](snotelC/snotelC_sampleprocessing.md)for returned samples. This links to other procedures.

* Litter mass samples are missing from Farmington Lower (though there were some samples sent to SIRFER)

**6-13-2012**

* Created the sample tables page (above) and am slowly figuring out what samples have been analyzed and what still need to be.
* 2008 O and M1 samples were treated a little differently than subsequent years. The 5 plot samples were processed individually rather than bulked, and then only a bulk acidified sample, which have different sample numbers, was run at SIRFER. See TO DO below.
* TO DO:
  * 2008 O and M1 samples - bulk the 5 plot samples into a single sample cup (1 per plot).
    * **Done** --- *[Greg Maurer](primaryproductivity@gmail.com) 2012/06/15 21:57*
  * Run the 2008 O and M1 samples (now bulked) at SIRFER (without acidifying).
  * Run 2009 `acidified` O and M1 samples (mostly loaded into tray 1105) at SIRFER.
  * Compare results for acidified and native O and M1 samples (2008/9) to see if this continues to be necessary.
  * Find Rock Creek M2 samples (6-12cm) if they exist.
    * **They don't exist**, and my guess is the mineral samples were to 12cm, but not sure. --- *[Greg Maurer](primaryproductivity@gmail.com)2012/06/15 21:31*
  * Process remaining 2011 site samples (CHP, MM, RC).
  * Subsample and acidify all intact core samples?
  * Sand/silt/clay from 2008 mineral sample bags, 2009 tins, 2011 intact cores.
  * Should I weigh the roots/wood samples from the tins and cores and add them to the bulk density spreadsheet?
  * Need to enter the data into the processing sheet (to include all rock weights, etc.) 
    * **Done** --- [Greg Maurer](primaryproductivity@gmail.com) 2012/06/22 05:31

* Looking through 2008 and 2009 CWD and litter sampling
* There are missing litter values from 2008 and I either marked them as "Not collected" or "No Litter" since one or the other is likely (there must have been litter at some sites that are missing a sample).
* Difficult to decide where to put the CWD measurements that are in the O horizon section of the field sheets. I am going to calculate volumes for these and add them to Litter layer wood numbers (based on volume x std wood density) for 2008 and to Organic horizon wood for 2009 and 2011 (I think this accurately reflects what I was doing in these different years).

**6-28-2011**

* Mineral samples 2009 are being acidified today
* Root grinding for all samples (2008 and 2009) completed today - currently inventorying them
* Litter samples for 2008 were loaded into tins and put in a tray (by Richard) today.
* The three leftover 2009 Litter vials (Louis Meadow) were loaded into this tray also.

**6-25-2011**

* 2009 Mineral and Organic samples have been acidified, ground and weighed into tins - need to be organized and have the trays completed with more samples.
* Tray 1103: 2008 litter, ground, weighed into tins, ready - along with LM samples in same tray, this completes the 2008 2009 litter sampling.
* Tray 1103: also has most 2009 tin samples that are acidified ground and ready to go.
* Tray 1104: 2008 & 9 roots have been ground and weighed into tins, plus remainder of 2009 tins.
* Acidified rerun of 2009 Mineral and Organic samples have been acidified, ground and weighed into tins - need to be organized and have the tray completed with more samples.

**6-20-2011**

* Started Richard Malyn on bulk density mesurements for SNOTEL soil tins. This consists of screening the entire tin sample to <2mm, weighing the sifted soil, measuring the volume of all rocks >2mm, and separating out roots and wood >2mm.

**Spring 2011**

* Organic samples 2009 - Ground, weighed, and run at SIRFER
* Mineral 1 (0-10) samples 2009 - Ground, weighed, and run at SIRFER
* Litter samples 2009 - Ground, weighed, and run at SIRFER **EXCEPT** Louis Meadow (3 vials)
* Organic and mineral 1 samples should be acidified and run again
* There are some samples that need to be rerun

**A long time ago**

* Organic horizon samples 2008 - Ground, weighed, acidified, and run at SIRFER
* Mineral 1 (0-10) samples 2008 - Ground, weighed, acidified, and run at SIRFER
