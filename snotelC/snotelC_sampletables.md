# SNOTEL survey sample tracking tables

Many samples are returned from each SNOTEL site visit. These tables help
track them as they are processed and analyzed.

**See also:**

* The sampling spreadsheet in the project directory logs EVERY sample returned from the field.
* The [Sample processing log](snotelC_sampleprocessinglog_1.md)provides day-to-day accounts of work on these samples.
* The [SNOTEL visit log](snotelC_log1.md)for notes on site visits.
* The [field protocol](snotelC_fieldprotocol.md)describes field methods and samples collected during SNOTEL site visits.
* The [initial processing procedures](snotelC_sampleprocessing.md)for samples. This links to other procedures.
