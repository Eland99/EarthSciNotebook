# SNOTEL survey sample tracking tables

Many samples are returned from each SNOTEL site visit. These tables help
track them as they are processed and analyzed.

` * The sampling spreadsheet in the project directory logs EVERY sample returned from the field.
` * The `[`Sample` `processing`
`log`](sampleprocessinglog_1)` provides day-to-day accounts of work on these samples.
` * The `[`SNOTEL` `visit`
`log`](snotellog_1)` for notes on site visits.
` * The `[`field`
`protocol`](snotelfieldprotocol)` describes field methods and samples collected during SNOTEL site visits.
` * The `[`initial` `processing`
`procedures`](snotelsampleprocessing)` for samples. This links to other procedures.`
