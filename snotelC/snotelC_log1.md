## 2012

` * **Sept 5** Little Bear visit - There are no conifers directly around the SNOTEL, so I visited a site around 6km to the WNW. All normal soil samples plus several leaf samples, tree cores, and 9 intact cores.
` * **Aug 17** Smith and Morehouse visit - All normal soil samples plus 3 needle samples, and 8 intact cores. The tree corer jammed on the first core, so I was unable to collect a usable set of tree cores.
` * **Aug 7** Snowbird visit - All normal soil samples plus 9 tree cores, 3 needle samples, and 8 intact cores. Intact cores were difficult to extract and most are incomplete. Gave up on many of the deeper ones.
` * **July 30-31** Hole in Rock visit - All normal soil samples plus 9 tree cores, 3 needle samples, and 8 intact cores. Intact cores were difficult to extract and most are incomplete. Could not extract one for Plot 3 20-30cm.`

## 2011

` * ** August???** - Revisit to Ben Lomond Trail for soil cores, tree cores, needles. I forget which day I actually did this.
` * ** Aug 16-18 ** - Did Mosby Mountain and Chepeta (Eastern Uintas, south slope), and revisited Rock Creek SNOTEL to collect soil cores, tree cores, and needles.
` * ** Aug 1 ** - Hayden Fork and Trial Lake revisits. Collected tree cores (2 per plot at HF, 3 at TL), intact cores (0-10cm, 10-20cm, 20-30cm at each plot), and needles (bulked 3 trees per plot).
`   * 2 or more of the cores from HF were from recently dead trees, and many of the trees in this stand are dead now due to beetles.
`   * Trial lake P2 core 20-30 is incomplete
`   * Noticed many large tree stumps at Trial Lake (these are quite old, just not sure if I noticed them last time)
` * ** July 27 ** - Ben Lomond Peak revisit, with Richard. Sampled a 4th plot - all normal samples (including tree cores and intact cores). Also revisited plot 1 & 2 to collect needles, cores, and intact cores (3 at each plot).
` * ** July 19 ** - Timpanogos Divide, with Richard and Davis. All normal soil samples, plus 9 tree cores, 8 intact cores, and 6 tins.`
