# Soil analysis

## Soils from flask resp measurements

These were run for %C and δ^13^C at
[SIRFER](http://sirfer.utah.edu/).

` * `[`Soil` `prep`](procedures:ea-irms_soilprep)` methods.`

## Soil extracts

Soil samples were collected at all forest plots. Soils were homogenized,
a subsample was fumigated with chloroform, and fumigated and unfumigated
samples were then extracted with a salt solution. The extracts must be
analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and
δ^13^C. There is currently no method for δ^13^C analysis of soil
extracts at SIRFER.

Preliminary info
----------------

` * 5g soil extracted with 25ml of 0.5M K`~`2`~`SO`~`4`~\
` * Nicole Trahan's data from similar Niwot Ridge soil extracts show between 200 and 2500 µg C/g of dry soil.
`   * If ours are similar, we should expect between 40 and 500 µgC/ml of extract.`

TOC/TN Analysis
---------------

We are sending subsamples of our extracts (3-4ml) to the [Kiowa
lab](http://snobear.colorado.edu/Seiboldc/kiowa.html) in
Colorado. These will be run on a Shimadzu TOC instrument using a
combustion with catalyst method.

δ13C Analysis
-------------

This analysis will be done at the SIRFER lab. There is currently no
protocol for δ^13^C measurements of soil extracts at SIRFER. Originally,
we proposed to run the freeze dried extracts on an EA-IRMS unit there.
Unfortunately, these extracts contain too much salt for the combustion
system. To run 0.4mg of C through the system, a sample containg around
70mg of salt (or more) would need to to be loaded into the instrument.
The C in the extracts must be run without this salt (some possible
methods for this are in the references below). We will use a form of
liquid oxidation to produce CO~2~ from the C in the extracts and then
run the CO~2~ to the mass spec from the Gasbench. Here is a proposed
outline:

` - Prepare sugar standard extracts (for testing and as reference material during analysis)
`   - See `[`here`](procedures:soilextract_13c#Sugar_Standards)\
` - Place a small amount of extract in an Exetainer.
` - Scrub out all CO`~`2`~` in the headspace of the vial (vacuum?).
` - Add an oxidant to convert C in extracts to CO`~`2`~`. There are multiple possible oxidants.
` - Load exetainers into the Gasbench and run through the MS from there.
`   - It may be necessary to purify the CO`~`2`~` before it enters the MS using some type of cryotrapping.`
