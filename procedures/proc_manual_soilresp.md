# Handheld soil respiration measurements

Growing season soil CO~2~ fluxes are measured at respiration collars
using the [Li-Cor 6400](instruments/inst_li-6400.md) and a handheld
soil respiration chamber (LiCor 6400-09).

In use at:

* [Hidden Canyon](hiddencanyon/hc_soilresplog_1.md)

## Collar installation

PVC collars are inserted in the soil at field sites to make soil
respiration measurements with the LI-6400. Collars should be made from
~4 inch (10cm) PVC tubing to accommodate the 9.55cm diameter
LiCor-6400-09 chamber. The tubing should be cut at roughly 5cm lengths
and then beveled on one edge. These are inserted 1.5-3cm into the soil
surface in the location where respiration is to be measured. Because
installation of the collars severs roots and upsets the CO~2~ gradient,
they should be installed at least 12 hours prior to measurement.

## Measurement Procedures

#### Materials checklist

- LiCor 6400 (in carrying case)
- LiCor 6400-09 handheld soil CO~2~ flux chamber (attaches to the IRGA)
- Cables/tubing for connecting items 1 and 2 (in carrying case)
- 2 fully charged LiCor batteries
- 2 full charged **spare batteries**
- Pack frame for carrying the case (if hiking into the field)
- Soil temperature probe (Omega Type-T thermocouple probe) assuming the LiCor 6400's is broken as usual.
  - Bring the probe AND its console
- Notebook
- Pen
- Span gas tank - optional, see the notes in the [measurement procedure](instruments:li-6400.md).

#### Making measurements with the LI-6400

The general procedure for operating the LiCor 6400 is on the **[instrument page.](instruments/inst_li-6400.md)**

* This procedure will need to be adapted for each site (see below and notes on the instrument page)

#### General site considerations

* **Number and location of collars**
  * Depends on the site
* **Moving collars**
  * Collars may remain stationary through the growing season, or they can be moved prior to each measurement.
    * This depends on research objectives.
  * Allow 12+ hours of recovery after hammering collars in at a new location.
* **Measurement frequency:**
  * Every two weeks during the growing season is excellent
  * Less frequently during shoulder seasons?
* **Time of measurements:**
  * Morning might be cold
  * Afternoons might be too hot
  * Night might exclude autotrophic components
  * Timing should probably be similar between measurement periods
* **Order of collar measurement:**
  * If measuring a control and treatment plot, alternate the measurements so that soil temperature changes during the measurement period occur evenly between treatments.

#### Notes for Hidden Canyon

* Typical `Aux OP Parameters`:
  * Extra drawdown = 5ppm
  * Flow = 500
  * Dead time = 20 sec
  * Minimum measurement time = 30 seconds
* `Delta` of around 5-6 usually works best, more if there are lots of roots.
* May need to modify things to stay within `Target +/- Delta` range.
* Measure the soil temperature at 5cm and 15cm depths using the Omega probe (the Li-Cor one is busted)
