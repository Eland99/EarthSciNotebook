###### Snowmelt acceleration by dust deposition

Artificial dust deposition on snow surfaces is hypothesized to lower the
albedo of the snow surface, increase shortwave energy absorption, and
accelerate the spring snowmelt cycle. This is a procedure to generate
dust similar to naturally deposited dust in the western U.S. and
distribute it on a snowpack.

` * Prodedure in use at `[`Hidden`
`Canyon`](hiddencanyon:sitedescription)` (and expected to influence `[`ecohydrology`](hc_ecohydrology:overview)` (plant water balance, soil moisture, C cycling) in plots with enhanced dust deposition.`\
` * `[`Regional` `dust` `sources`](:westerndust)\
` * The `[`snowmelt`
`measurements`](hc_ecohydrology:snowmeltlog_1)` page for Hidden Canyon.`

#### Dust collection and preparation

` - Dust is dug from the ground at an appropriate `[`source`
`site`](:westerndust)`. Care is taken not to dig large amounts of organic matter, seeds, roots, etc. `\
` - Dust dried in drying ovens for at least 24 hours`\
` - Sift to 500Âµm or less.`

#### Dust application

Dust is applied to the snow surface in treatment plots during the spring
snowmelt season. Dust application begins before peak snowpack (April
15), and dust is reapplied each time new snow covers the prior dust
layer until the snowpack has melted completely.

Application amounts (Hidden Canyon experiment)
----------------------------------------------

` * Target deposition rate: ~5g per m`^`2`^\
` * Application area: 10m by ~70m = 700 m`^`2`^\
` * Probable number of applications: 8`\
` * Total dust needed: 5g x 700 m`^`2`^` x 8 = 28000g`

Application equipment
---------------------

` - **Blower method** Dust is blown onto the snowpack using a small ShopVac modified to blow air through a PVC extension. The PVC pipe is fitted with a dust "cartridge" (a mason jar) that feeds dust into the airstream at a steady rate. The blower is powered by a 12V battery and inverter carried in a backpack. Each mason jar holds 1200g of dust. Roughly 3 should cover a 700m`^`2`^` plot. This method was used in 2010 at Hidden Canyon.`\
` - **Throwing method** Dust is scattered tossed by hand onto the snowpack.`\
` - The best days for either method are relatively calm days with little wind.`

#### Useful measurements

` * Measuring snowmelt (SWE disappearance) is best done by sampling the snowpack with a Federal Sampler as described on the `[`SWE`
`measurement`](procedures:measuringswe)` page.`\
` * `[`Measuring` `sublimation` `at` `the` `snow`
`surface`](procedures:snowsurfacesublimation)` (multiple methods).`\
` * `[`Snowpack` `albedo`
`measurements`](procedures:snowpackalbedo)\
` * `[`Measuring` `snowpack` `dust`
`loading`](procedures:snowpackdustloading)` (natural or artificial). `
