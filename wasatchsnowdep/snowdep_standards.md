# Mixing standards for ion analysis

An example for NaCl:

* Molar mass of NaCl (the sum of its atomic masses - 22.9897 + 35.453) = 58.4427g
* Dissolving 1 mole (58.4427g) in 1L water gives a solution that:
  * is 1 Molar NaCl (1 mole of each ion species)
  * has 1 equivalent (molar mass/valence) each of Na^+^ and Cl^-^.
  * is 1 Normal (1N) for each of Na^+^ and Cl^-^.
  * contains 22.9898g Na^+^ and 35.453g Cl^-^ per liter
* Dissolving 2.5420 g sodium chloride in 1L water gives a solution that:
  * is 0.043495 Molar (2.5420g/58.4427g•mol^-1^).
  * has 43.495 milliequivalents each of Na^+^ and Cl^-^.
  * is 0.043495 Normal for each of Na^+^ and Cl^-^.
  * contains 1000mg Na^+^ per liter (0.043495 mol x 22.9898g•mol^-1^).
  * contains 1542.03mg Cl^-^ per liter (0.043495 mol x 35.453g•mol^-1^)

## Stock solutions

These are modeled after the Kiowa stock solutions found at the [Kiowa procedures page](http://snobear.colorado.edu/Kiowa/Kiowaref/procedure.html).
Generally these are mixed to yield a 1000mg/L solution for the desired ion.

For each stock solution mix the following ingredients in a 500ml
volumetric flask.

  * 0.010410mol x 174.2592g•mol^-1^ K~2~SO~4~ = 1.81404g
  * Divide by 2.

  * 1000mg NH~4~^+^ *-N** = 1g/14.0067g•mol^-1^ N = 0.071394mol N.

**Note that the target here is 500mgCa^+2^/L**

* **Step 1:**0.62434g CaCO~3~ and 50ml DI H~2~O.
  * 500mg Ca^2+^ = 0.5g/40.078g•mol^-1^ Ca^+^ = 0.012476mol Ca.
  * 0.012476mol x 100.0869g•mol^-1^ CaCO~3~ = 1.24868g
  * Divide by 2.

### Lab Blanks

These are filtered DI water, serving as the zero point for our samples.
Just filter ~100ml DI water from the tap in the same way that a sample
would be treated and put it in a clean nalgene to be included in the
sample run. Put three of these in for each sample run.

#### Batch 2

Decided to make combined standards this time - 3 low concentration, 3
high concentration, with concentrations based on the ranges for our
first set of samples. For each standard (High and Low) follow the
directions below and add the required amount of solution to a clean
500ml volumetric flask. Once all ion solutions are added, fill the flask
to 500ml with DI water. This solution will fill 3 containers with
identical High or Low standard.
