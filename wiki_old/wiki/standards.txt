===== Conventions =====

  - This site is intended for **scientific** collaboration. It is **not** to be used for:
    - Research unrelated to climate, ecosystems, and carbon or water cycling.
    - Commentaries on climate change or the vast conspiracy behind climate science.
    - Rambling about random subjects - stick to research ideas and activities such as measurements, methodology, results, and relevant discussions about these things.
  - Cite relevant research papers mentioned in your text with a footnote (see the [[wiki:syntax#Footnotes|syntax]] page).
  - Please look at the content of the site before posting or editing and try to be consistent with the style (such as it is) of this content.
  - Before creating a page, make sure it is consistent with the [[doku>namespaces]] and [[doku>pagename]] conventions used on this site. The [[:topicindex|topic index]] is a good way to familiarize yourself with the site's organization. **For example:** If you add a research project, give it a namespace (//new_project//) and first describe it with a new //overview// page in that namespace (ie. //newproject:overview//). You can add site-specific pages, like measurement logs, preliminary data, etc., to the  project namespace (ie. //new_project:soilcollectionlog//). If you add procedures or other info that can be generalized to other projects, put them in the appropriate namespace (//procedures//, or //instruments// for example).
  - Please send us an email if you are contributing to, or would like to contribute, the site. We'd love to chat with people with similar research projects and interests.
