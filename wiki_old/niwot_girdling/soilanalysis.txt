======Soil analysis======

=====Soils from flask resp measurements=====
These were run for %C and δ<sup>13</sup>C at [[http://sirfer.utah.edu/|SIRFER]].
  * [[procedures:ea-irms_soilprep|Soil prep]] methods.

=====Soil extracts=====
Soil samples were collected at all forest plots. Soils were homogenized, a subsample was fumigated with chloroform, and fumigated and unfumigated samples were then extracted with a salt solution. The extracts must be analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), and δ<sup>13</sup>C. There is currently no method for δ<sup>13</sup>C analysis of soil extracts at SIRFER. 

==Preliminary info==
  * 5g soil extracted with 25ml of 0.5M K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
  * Nicole Trahan's data from similar Niwot Ridge soil extracts show between 200 and 2500 µg C/g of dry soil.
    * If ours are similar, we should expect between 40 and 500 µgC/ml of extract.

==TOC/TN Analysis==

We are sending subsamples of our extracts (3-4ml) to the [[http://snobear.colorado.edu/Seiboldc/kiowa.html|Kiowa lab]] in Colorado. These will be run on a Shimadzu TOC instrument using a combustion with catalyst method.

==δ13C Analysis==

This analysis will be done at the SIRFER lab. There is currently no protocol for δ<sup>13</sup>C measurements of soil extracts at SIRFER. Originally, we proposed to run the freeze dried extracts on an EA-IRMS unit there. Unfortunately, these extracts contain too much salt for the combustion system. To run 0.4mg of C through the system, a sample containg around 70mg of salt (or more) would need to to be loaded into the instrument. The C in the extracts must be run without this salt (some possible methods for this are in the references below). We will use a form of liquid oxidation to produce CO<sub>2</sub> from the C in the extracts and then run the CO<sub>2</sub> to the mass spec from the Gasbench. Here is a proposed outline:

  - Prepare sugar standard extracts (for testing and as reference material during analysis)
    - See [[procedures:soilextract_13c#Sugar Standards|here]]
  - Place a small amount of extract in an Exetainer.
  - Scrub out all CO<sub>2</sub> in the headspace of the vial (vacuum?).
  - Add an oxidant to convert C in extracts to CO<sub>2</sub>. There are multiple possible oxidants.
  - Load exetainers into the Gasbench and run through the MS from there.
    - It may be necessary to purify the CO<sub>2</sub> before it enters the MS using some type of cryotrapping.
