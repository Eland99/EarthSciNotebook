===== Filtering samples for Kiowa lab =====
== Materials list ==
  - Thawed snow samples in their nalgene bottles
  - A data entry spreadsheet that includes their sample numbers and a place to enter notes, sample bottle tare weights, and sample weights.
    - This can be derived from the sample log
  - 3 250ml Filter flasks (Erlenmeyer type with sideport)
  - 2 Millipore filters
  - 47mm Nuclepore filter membranes
  - 2 vacuum hoses
  - Clean 125ml nalgenes
  - Labeling tape
  - Sharpie

== Filtration procedure ==
  - Thaw samples
  - Put on clean gloves, and change them often
  - Set up a clean lab bench:
    - Clean all filter flasks with soap, and give them a good rinse in DI water.
    - Clean both Millipore filters.
    - Rinse rubber stoppers
    - Lay out clean lab mats (2) across the bench.
  - Place Nuclepore membrane on the plate of the Millipore filter.
  - Screw the top onto the plate and slide the rubber stopper over the filtrate outlet
  - Place the Millipore assembly on the opening of a filter flask.
  - Attach the vaccuum hose to the sideport of the flask.
  - Turn on the vaccuum about halfway
  - Run 120-150 ml of DI water through the filter
  - Detach the filter flask, throw this filtrate away, then reattach the flask.
  - Turn the vaccuum back on
  - Filter roughly 80-100 ml of sample through the filter
  - Weigh and label a clean 125ml nalgene with the sample id number
  - Also label the original sample nalgene with the sample id number
  - Pour the filtered sample from the filter flask into the nalgene
  - Weigh the nalgene + sample and record this on the spreadsheet.
