  * Cleaned up the pm2.5 data using find/replace in vim
  * Rebuilt the sampletracking data file from the spreadsheet, removing some bad data/samples
  * Made worksheet for filtering samples
  * Generated timeline graphs of all samples taken (all and by category), and those sent/to-be-sent to Kiowa

  * Created a sample log file for matlab (sampletracking_110505.txt).
  * Downloaded hourly pm2.5 data provided by DAQ from [[http://pcaps.utah.edu|PCAPS page]].
    * This data is in separate files for each day, so I concatenated them into one file with a bash script (see below)
  * Created a matlab script that reads sample log file and pm2.5 data and outputs a timeline of samples taken, and which have been run.

Bash code to concatenate the daily pm2.5 files (minus headers in each file)
  # Run from directory containing all files
  # Last 24 lines in each file contain the data (the top is all header stuff)
  for i in *.txt; do tail -24 "$i" >> newfile.txt; done
