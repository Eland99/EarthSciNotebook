===== Results =====
Pages containing preliminary research results, figures, and some discussion.
== Continuous data ==
  * :-)[[results:hc_towers|Tower data from Hidden Canyon]] - mostly met data from the Met and Forest towers.
  * :-)[[results:hc_profiles|Soil profile data from Hidden Canyon]] - Soil moisture and temperature from 8 profiles.

===== Sites =====
These pages describe research sites and link to relevant data sources and activity logs. Three primary research sites are currently active in this project:
  - :-)[[sites:hiddencanyon|Hidden Canyon]] in the Wasatch Mountains near Salt Lake City.
    * A south-facing mixed conifer forest at 9500 feet. It is instrumented with met stations and soil moisture/temperature profiles. A snowpack manipulation, and soil respiration and decomposition measurements will be conducted here through 2012. The site was established by the Bowling Lab in the Fall of 2009.
    * :-)[[sites:hc_2010_log|2010 activity log]], :-)[[sites:hc_2011_log|2011 activity log]]
  - [[sites:snowsurvey|NRCS Snow Survey sites]] located in mountains around the western U.S. (http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/)
    * This is a network of mountain sites where manual (snow courses) and automated (SNOTEL sites) measurements of snowpack (SWE) are taken for water supply forecasting. Manual measurements date back to the 1930's.
  - [[sites:niwotridge|Niwot Ridge]] - a high elevation [[http://www.lternet.edu/|LTER]] and [[http://public.ornl.gov/ameriflux/|Ameriflux]] site in Colorado.
    * A high elevation supalpine forest and alpine tundra site. Extensive research on tundra and forest ecology has been in progress here for a long time. The Bowling lab has instrumentation that measures biosphere-atmosphere interactions (CO<sub>2</sub> mainly).
