======Text files======
Text files are perhaps the simplest and most interoperable format for storing and exchanging data. Here are some tips and utilities for manipulating and effectively using text files in a UNIX-like environment.

=====Text operations=====

====Find (grep) text in the contents of multiple files====

  grep -Hrn 'search term' path/to/files
where ''-H'' prints the filename (default if called on a dir), ''-r'' is recurse (search in subdirectories), and ''-n'' prints the line number where the search term occurs in the file. To match a particular filename or extension add ''--include=file.*'' (or any regexp). ''--exclude-dir=dir'' is useful for excluding directories like ''.svn'' and ''.git''.

''find'', followed by a call to ''grep'' is also an option.
  find /path -type f -exec grep -l "string" {} +
where ''-type f'' means search only files, ''-exec grep...'' specifies the ''grep'' search to run for ''{}'' (each file found).

====Search/replace text in multiple files====
Using just sed:

  # Replace "phrase1" with "phrase2" in all "file*.txt" files in the current directory, 
  # and append ".bak" to the original files.
  sed -i.bak 's/phrase1/phrase2/g' file*.txt 
  
Using find, and piping to sed - no backup copy made
    find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i 's/phrase1/phrase2/g'
====Diff/merge====

There are plenty of diff-merge tools, including ''vimdiff''. For diffing files with long lines (paragraphs in documents), [[http://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/|''wdiff'']] should help.

=====Markup languages=====

When drafting text documents, markup languages can be used to add formatting or other information to plain text. This makes text more readable, and the markup text can be parsed by an interpreter to render the content in other document formats (ie. HTML, LaTeX documents, .docx files, etc.).
