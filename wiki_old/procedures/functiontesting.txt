====== Testing data analysis functions ======
Code used in data analysis can perform fairly complex operations on datasets and generate output that may be significantly changed from the original data. The code itself can also be fairly complex and its actual function may be difficult to discern just by reading the code or looking at the data. It is important to verify that the result of running this code is what is expected and that the output is accurate. Writing test functions that call data analysis code and analyze their output is a useful way to do this.

=====Matlab=====
In Matlab, testing scripts are generally put in a "functiontesting" subdirectory. When it is time to run the tests, add this path (''addpath('./functiontesting')'') and then run the test scripts from the commandline.
