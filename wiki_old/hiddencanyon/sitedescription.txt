====== Hidden Canyon (Wasatch Mtns, UT) ======
{{:hiddencanyon:hc_10-24-08_scaled_.jpg?250 |Hidden Canyon site in October 2008}}
**Location description**
  * Elevation: 9400 ft
  * Aspect: 197-205° (South-Southwest)
  * Slope: 20-22° at towers
  * Dominant tree species: Engelmann spruce, Subalpine fir, Aspen
  * There are 2 [[hiddencanyon:georeferencing|georeferenced grids]] and other markers.
  * Site of [[hc_ecohydrology:overview|ecohydrology experiments]] (snowmelt, soil carbon cycling, and plant water balance) 
  * Established by the Bowling Lab in the Fall of 2009.

===== Measurements =====
**Hidden Canyon has:**
  * A [[hiddencanyon:mettowers|meteorological tower]] located in a clearing to the west of the study forest.
  * A [[hiddencanyon:mettowers|forest met tower]] that records aboveground and belowground climate variables in the forest.
  * Eight [[hiddencanyon:soilprofiles|soil profiles]] that measure soil temperature and water content.
  * Some [[hc_ecohydrology:snowmeltlog_1|snow measurements]], part of the [[hc_ecohydrology:overview|ecohydrology experiments]].
  * [[hc_ecohydrology:soilresplog_1|Soil respiration]] measurements
  * [[hc_ecohydrology:litterbaglog_1|Decomposition measurements]] using litterbags
  * [[hc_ecohydrology:ecosystemwaterlog_1|Xylem water potential]] measurements
  * All trees have location, species, and status data [[trees|here]].

===== Communication =====
This site is connected to the internet via a wireless modem. This modem is connected via radio to both dataloggers, so both can be accessed from the Bowling lab with LoggerNet. See [[hiddencanyon:communicationsystem|this page]] for information on how this works.
