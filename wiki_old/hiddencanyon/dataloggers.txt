====== Hidden Canyon dataloggers ======
There are two Campbell CR23x dataloggers at [[hiddencanyon:sitedescription|Hidden Canyon]]:
  * **Met1** is located on the [[hiddencanyon:mettowers|met tower]] and it logs meteorological data and powers the [[hiddencanyon:communicationsystem|modem, and the Base and Met1 radios]].
  * **Forest1** is located on the [[hiddencanyon:mettowers|forest tower]] and it logs meteorological data and [[hiddencanyon:soilprofiles|soil profile]] data (via 3 multiplexers).

Both of these dataloggers are connected via radio to the [[hiddencanyon:communicationsystem|communications system]].
