# Shell scripting tips

Notes on using the Unix shell (bash, ash, et. al) to manipulate files,
text, etc.

        page](programming), [the Awk page](awk),
        [Vim tips](vimtips), [Text file
        tips](textfiles).

## Basic stuff

Assign variables like this:

VAR="foo"  # don't use any spaces around the = sign`

Expand variables with \$:

echo $VAR # prints "foo" to stdout`

If the location of the variable is unclear in the input string use curly
braces:

echo $VARbar # prints nothing
echo ${VAR}bar # prints "foobar"`

Single quoted strings are interpreted literally:

echo '$VAR' # prints "$VAR" to stdout`

Double quoted strings are interpreted literally except for \$, \`
(backquote), and \\ (escape).

echo "$VAR" # prints "foo" to stdout`

Double quotes also group space separated words or variable together and
can be used to append/prepend:

VAR2="bar foobar"
VAR3="foo$VAR2"
echo $VAR3 # prints "foobar foobar"`

Backquoted strings are executed by your shell and are then replaced by
the output of that execution, so:

` echo The current date and time is: `date``

Outputs:

The current date and time is: Thu Feb 24 23:19:17 MST 2011`

The backslash escapes the metacharacter (\$,\`,',") just after it so it
is interpreted as a string"

echo \$VAR # prints "$VAR" to stdout`

## Redirection and piping

The *&gt;* operator redirects the standard output (or stderr sometimes)
of a command to a file.

ls -l > ls-l.txt # Writes the output of the ls command to ls-l.txt`

*&gt;&gt;* will append to a file, rather than clobber the existing file
with a new one. You can also set a "noclobber" option as the default in
bash.

Redirecting in the opposite directions, *&lt;*, can be used to feed the
contents of a file into a command.

cat < textfile1 > textfile2 # Same as "cp textfile1 textfile2"
`

The *|* operator "pipes" the standard output of a command to the
standard input of another command or process.

ps axl | grep zombie # select and show zombie processes from the full list of processes`

## Command line scripts

Simple shell scripts can be run from the command line, separating
commands with a semicolon.

 **Nice utilities to put in shell commands and scripts: **

* The usual file commands `*`cp`*`, `*`mv`*`, `*`rm`*`, etc.
* `*`grep`*`: prints text (from a file or standard input) matching a sequence of characters.
* `*`cut`*`: cuts columns out of delimited files
* `*`tr`*`: (translate) deletes (-d) or replaces characters in a file
* `*`tail`*`: prints the last //n// lines in a given file (good for removing headers).
* `*`sed`*commands (see `[`this`
`tutorial`](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html)`)
* `[`awk`one`liners`](procedures:awk)

For example in a particular directory, a list of files with the .csv
extension can be generated with a simple loop:

greg@gm-thinkpad:~/Downloads/station_inventory$ for i in *.csv; do echo "$i"; done
AZ_soilstations.csv
CO_soilstations.csv
ID_soilstations.csv
MT_soilstations.csv
NM_soilstations.csv
NV_soilstations.csv
UT_soilstations.csv
WY_soilstations.csv`

Using the same loop format, copies and substitutions to the filename can
be made:

greg@gm-thinkpad:~/Downloads/station_inventory$ for i in *.csv; do cp "$i" "${i/.csv}2.csv"; done
greg@gm-thinkpad:~/Downloads/station_inventory$ ls
AZ_soilstations2.csv  MT_soilstations2.csv  UT_soilstations2.csv
AZ_soilstations.csv   MT_soilstations.csv   UT_soilstations.csv
CO_soilstations2.csv  NM_soilstations2.csv  WY_soilstations2.csv
CO_soilstations.csv   NM_soilstations.csv   WY_soilstations.csv
ID_soilstations2.csv  NV_soilstations2.csv
ID_soilstations.csv   NV_soilstations.csv`

A similar effect to the substitution could be done with basename.

 **Sed, Awk, and tr** all replace characters or patterns
        in textfiles. To remove all spaces from a directory of
        textfiles:

`for`i`in`*.csv;`do`tr`-d`'`'`<`"$i"`>`
`"${i/.csv}2.csv";`doneTo replace each line's first occurrence of a
given phrase with another pattern, either of these will work: `for`i`
`in`*.csv;`do`sed`'s/station`id/station_id/'`<`"$i"`>`
`"${i/.csv}2.csv";`doneOR `for`i`in`*.csv;`do`awk`-F","`
`'{`sub(/station`id/,`"station_id");`print`}'`"$i"`>`
`"${i/.csv}2.csv";`doneTo replace all occurrences of the pattern use
global replacement - add a g after the sed statement, or use gsub
instead of sub in awk.

This command will take each .csv file, cut out columns 13-15, and
redirect this output to a new file. `for`FILE`in`*.csv;`do`
`cut`-d","`-f-12,16-`"$FILE"`>`"${FILE/.csv}2.csv";`done`

## Executing saved scripts

- Start scripts with the path to bash (#!/bin/bash)
- Make sure they are executable
- From the current working directory they can be run with "bash scriptname" OR "./scriptname`
