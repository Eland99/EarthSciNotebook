# Integration

Need to calculate the area under a curve or data series? Here are some
ways to do it.

## Integrating a function

## Integrating using samples

` * The `[`scipy.integrate`](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/integrate.html)` package offers some ways to do this:`

`   trapz         -- Use trapezoidal rule to compute integral from samples.
`   cumtrapz      -- Use trapezoidal rule to cumulatively compute integral.
`   simps         -- Use Simpson's rule to compute integral from samples.
`   romb          -- Use Romberg Integration to compute integral from
`                   (2**k + 1) evenly-spaced samples.
`                   
` * MATLAB also has similar functions.`
