###### Multilevel models

These are models for grouped data in which datapoints may be correlated,
and there is a need to treat variance differently among the groups. They
are variously called //multilevel//, //mixed//, or //heirarchical//
models.

Suitable for longitudinal data in which one is interested in estimating
coefficients for groups or individuals within the population, rather
than for the population at large.

There is a chapter (10) in Ben Bolker's book about them.
